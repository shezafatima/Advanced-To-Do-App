# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### State & Data Standards Compliance
- [ ] All state changes will be explicit and specification-driven
- [ ] No hidden or implicit state mutations will be permitted
- [ ] Data models will preserve backward compatibility unless explicitly revised
- [ ] Destructive data changes will have explicit migration specifications
- [ ] AI state mutations will have validated action specifications

### Evolution & Compatibility Rules Compliance
- [ ] Each phase will build upon the previous phase without regressions
- [ ] Public interfaces will remain stable unless explicitly revised by specification
- [ ] Breaking changes will have explicit deprecation and migration specifications
- [ ] Previous phase behavior will remain demonstrable after evolution

### AI Autonomy & Safety Standards Compliance
- [ ] AI agents will only perform actions explicitly defined in specifications
- [ ] AI agents will request clarification when required parameters are missing
- [ ] AI agents will not hallucinate identifiers, state, or system behavior
- [ ] All AI-initiated actions will be auditable and reversible where applicable

### Interface & Contract Standards Compliance
- [ ] All interfaces will have explicit contracts defining inputs, outputs, errors, and side effects
- [ ] Event-driven interactions will specify producers, consumers, and delivery guarantees
- [ ] No component will rely on undocumented behavior of another component

### Observability & Debuggability Standards Compliance
- [ ] All non-trivial operations will produce observable outcomes
- [ ] Errors will be surfaced with meaningful, user-appropriate messages
- [ ] System behavior will be explainable through logs, responses, or agent traces
- [ ] AI decisions will be traceable to specifications and inputs

### Infrastructure & Deployment Standards Compliance
- [ ] Infrastructure will be treated as a first-class, specification-driven component
- [ ] Deployment artifacts will be reproducible and deterministic
- [ ] Environment-specific behavior will be explicitly specified
- [ ] Infrastructure changes will not alter application semantics without specification updates

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
